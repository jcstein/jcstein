# üëã Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Josh and I'm a Developer Relations Engineer with Ankr, a decentralized Web3 infrastructure provider that operates an array of globally-distributed nodes serving 50+ blockchain networks. I am also an active member of Developer DAO, a tokenized community of Web3 builders. I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a BSc in Business concentrating in Supply Chain Management and Analytics along with a minor of Mathematics. I began working with Ankr in February and am excited to see where Web3 takes the global community.
